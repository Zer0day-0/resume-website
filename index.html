              <div id="leftbox01"> Hello World, I am Saurav, a self taught NGS-Programmer based out in Awizal, Mizoram, India. 
                Currently persuing PhD in Mizoram University. Previously, I graduated from KIIT University, Bhubaneswar in 2021. When Not exhaused from hiking in the mountains, 
                or fiddling with computers, I read research papers. I like eating good food, riding bikes and exploring cool stuff. Shell, Python, Rust and R are my tools of choice. 
                I also happen to write some HTML5, CSS and JS, but I'm nowhere near a pro.

                <div id="rightbox01">
                  I work in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which is a powerful 
                  next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique used to analyze 
                  the transcriptome, capturing the complete set of RNA 
                  transcripts in a sample. Studying the transcriptome gives
                  us a deeper insight into active genes and provides details 
                  about gene expression patterns, alternative splicing events, 
                  and regulatory mechanisms involved in diseases. </div>
                <div id="rightbox02">
                  I am highly experienced in DNA sequencing analysis and variant calling, 
                  which are essential components of next-generation sequencing (NGS).
                  My expertise includes preprocessing raw sequencing data, alignment, 
                  quality control, and applying advanced tools like GATK and DRAGEN 
                  pipelines. Through this experience, I have contributed to projects 
                  such as the analysis of Genome India data.</div>
